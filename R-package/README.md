## Introduction

The goal of manifoldsData is to provide a user-friendly API to obtain the manifolds datasets in the textbook "Nonparametric Statistics on Manifolds and Their Applications to Object Data Analysis".

## Installation

``` r
library(devtools)
install_github(repo = "Mamba413/ManifoldsData/R-package")
```


## Example

Load polyhedral3D projective shape data:

``` r
data(polyhedral3D)
```
